# Project Title: Predicting Housing Prices with Data Science

## Introduction
As a Data Scientist at Hass Consulting Company, a leading real estate firm with over 25 years of experience, the task at hand is to analyze the factors influencing housing prices. By leveraging the dataset containing information on real estate properties collected over recent months, the objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sale prices based on various predictor variables.

## Definition of the Research Question
The primary goal of this project is to study the factors that impact housing prices using the available real estate data. Subsequently, we aim to construct a robust predictive model capable of accurately estimating sale prices when provided with predictor variables.

## Metric for Success
Success in this project will be measured by the ability to create a predictive model with minimal assumptions about the dataset and low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The model's predictions should closely align with the actual sale prices of properties.

## Context
HassConsult is renowned for offering investment-grade developments across the city. These developments are meticulously planned and designed using a data-driven approach to ensure high-quality assets that yield substantial rental returns and capital growth. The Hass Index, Kenyaâ€™s first published property price index, provides valuable insights into property market dynamics, aiding investors, homeowners, and the financial industry in making informed decisions.

## Experimental Design
1. **Defining the Question**: Clearly articulate the research question, metric for success, and contextual background.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the provided dataset to understand its structure, features, and relationships.
3. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
4. **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis**: Analyze variables individually, explore relationships between variables, and assess multivariate interactions.
5. **Regression Analysis**: Apply various regression techniques such as Multiple Linear Regression, Quantile Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression.
6. **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Evaluate model performance, interpret results, and provide recommendations based on findings.
7. **Model Improvement**: Propose enhancements to the model and address potential limitations or challenges.

## Appropriateness of the Available Data
The dataset contains 20 variables, including the target variable (price), which are potentially correlated with housing prices. With no missing values and a diverse range of features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location details, the data appears suitable for predicting housing prices. Additionally, the dataset's quality is deemed satisfactory for analysis purposes.

## Description of Variables
- **Id**: Unique identifier for each property
- **Price**: Sale price of the house (target variable)
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms
- **Sqft_living**: Square feet area of living space
- **Sqft_lot**: Square feet area of parking layout
- **Floors**: Number of floors
- **Waterfront**: Indicates if the property has waterfront access
- **View**: Number of views from the property
- **Grade**: Overall grade assigned to the property
- **Sqft_above**: Square feet area above ground
- **Sqft_basement**: Square feet area of basement
- **Yr_built**: Year the house was built
- **Yr_renovated**: Year the house was renovated
- **Zipcode**: Zipcode of the property
- **Lat**: Latitude of the property
- **Lon**: Longitude of the property
- **Sqft_living15**: Square feet area of living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
- **Sqft_lot15**: Square feet area of parking layout for the nearest 15 neighbors

## Conclusion
By leveraging advanced regression techniques and thorough data analysis, Hass Consulting aims to gain valuable insights into housing price dynamics. The predictive model developed through this project will serve as a powerful tool for accurately forecasting property sale prices, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in the real estate market.
